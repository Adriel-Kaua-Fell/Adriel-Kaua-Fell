- 👋 Hi, I’m @Adriel-Kaua-Fell. I'm 18 years old and I love programming, and I'm excited to work on different projects and learn good practices, concepts and many other things.
- 👀 I'm interested in programming devices that make people's lives easier, and that can be constructive and improved over time, just like me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, and some tools like Java Swing, however, I am also studying web development at home, and learning website building concepts. I'm studying a technical course in IT in Univates, I have acquired knowledge about object-oriented concepts and how programming logic works. I admit that I have no contact with databases yet, but I guarantee that I am capable of learning it very quickly
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can improve my capacity of doing things by my own, and make good friends. It would also be nice if someone hired me for a job. I could cross the whole world to be part of something like a company.
